# Full CRUD App
Allow the students to individually work on building CRUD apps by following the [CRUD App Walkthrough](CrudAppWalkthrough.md). During this time, instructors should assist students with any issues they have. It may be beneficial to go over certain sections as a class, but for the most part, the students should be able to work at their own pace.

When the students finish building the CRUD app, they can start on their [Final Projects](../FinalProject/).

## Review Activity
At some point during the self-paced portion, take a break with a review activity. Play this [Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/626001bf34a6242f102ac990) in one of the varieties of game modes. You must create an account and log in to host the game.
