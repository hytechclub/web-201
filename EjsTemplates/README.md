# Express Projects
This lesson illustrates the need for templating, and introduces [EJS](https://ejs.co/) to serve that purpose. It covers the basics of EJS, including data object values, `if` statements, and `for` loops.

## Warm-up Practice
Have the students complete the [People List Starter App](PeopleListStarterApp.md) activity individually. This will help review concepts, and will help setup a demonstration for the purpose of templating.
