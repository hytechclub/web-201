# Databases Overview - Repl.it
This lesson introduces the concept of databases, and uses Replit's built-in database and `async`/`await` to demonstrate how they are used in full-stack web applications.

## Databases Introduction Warm-up Activity
Split the students into breakout rooms, with one instructor per room. Instruct the students in each room to work as a group and follow the instructions on [this page](DatabasesWarmUp.md).

## Instruction
- [Databases Overview PowerPoint Presentation](DatabasesOverview.pptx)
- Note that this presentation goes in-depth about JS Promises and the `async`/`await` pattern - it is okay if students do not fully grasp these concepts. They will have a chance to apply them during the code-along.
