# Movie Reviews Warm-up Activity
Whether you realize it or not, you probably interact with databases on a daily basis! There are databases behind almost every piece of software. In this activity, work as a group to make changes to a database of **movie reviews**.

### Group Apps
Each group will work within one app, split up as follows:

- **Group 1**: [App 1](https://moviereviews-1.josephmaxwell.repl.co/)
- **Group 2**: [App 2](https://moviereviews-2.josephmaxwell.repl.co/)
- **Group 3**: [App 3](https://moviereviews-3.josephmaxwell.repl.co/)
- **Group 4**: [App 4](https://moviereviews-4.josephmaxwell.repl.co/)

## Step One: Looking at Movie Reviews
First, visit the Movie Reviews app for your group and take a look around. Don't make any changes yet - start by simply _reading_ what is available.

## Step Two: Adding a New Review
Next, each member of the group should _create_ a new review. This can be about any movie (as long as it is appropriate). Notice that after creating new reviews, they should be visible by everybody automatically!

## Step Three: Updating an Existing Review
Next, each member of the group should choose one review to _update_. Make sure that each person updates a different review, so there are no overlaps. Notice again how the changes persist across the app for everybody!

## Step Four: Deleting a Review
Finally, each member should _delete_ one review. The review should disappear from the app entirely!
