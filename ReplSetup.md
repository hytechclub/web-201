## Replit Overview
**Replit** is a website that allows developers to _write_ and _run_ code right from a web browser!

- **Code Editor** - This is where developers write code
- **Run Button** - Developers click this button to _execute_ the code
- **Run Area** - This is where the developer sees the results of the code

In the new Repl, click the "Run" button to see the code execute. Note that nothing should happen at this point; there is no code written yet.

## Sharing Your Repl Account
Once your account is created, _make sure you share your username with your course instructors._
