# Final Project
Build a CRUD App using Node.js, Express, EJS, and MySQL.

## Background
Before starting the final project, complete the [CRUD App Walkthrough](../FullCrudApp/CrudAppWalkthrough.md). Feel free to use the final code from the walkthrough as a starting point for the project. However, **the app should keep track of a different type of data**.

## Requirements
A user should be able to:
- **C**reate rows in the database
- **R**ead data from the database
- **U**pdate existing rows in the database
- **D**elete rows from the database

### Implementation
- Store the project in a [new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new)
- Create at least one (1) new database table
- Create at least one (1) new page for the application
- Create at least one (1) new route for the application
- Update the styles for the application

## Presentations
Students will be expected to present their projects at the last meeting of the semester. On May 6, 2020, office hours will be from **5-6:30pm** for presentations.

### Content
The presentation should include:

- Background about the idea behind the app
- An overview of the app's functionality
- An explanation of any new topics learned
- A brief look into any relevant or interesting parts of the code
- A discussion of any challenges that arose during the project development

### Procedure

- Students should push all of their code to GitHub
    - Make sure the code is shared with the instructors
- If a student is able to share their screen and talk through their project on Zoom, that is preferred
    - If a student does not have a microphone, they can join the Zoom meeting from a telephone
    - If a student cannot share their screen, the instructor can show the student's project
- A student also has the option of recording a video presentation
- There will be a defined schedule and order for each student to present
- **If a student does not present a final project, they may not be able to move onto the next level of Hy-Tech Club**

## Ideas
This list of ideas is in no way comprehensive; feel free to go beyond and do something completely different!

### Enhancement Ideas
- A message asking "Are you sure you want to delete this object?"
- Custom styles for table rows based on data
- A separate "Information" page for each database object
- Sortable data table
- Images for each database object
- Preventing users from adding duplicates to the database
- A new database table that links to the main table via [foreign key](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-foreign-key/)

### Full Project Ideas
- To-Do List Application
- Recipe Application
- Blog Application
- Marketplace Application (e.g. craigslist)
- Social Media Application (e.g. Twitter)
- Movie Review Application (e.g. Letterboxd)
