# Final Project
The students should have some time to create a final project of their choosing. It can be similar to the [Full CRUD App](../FullCrudAppReplDb/) with some updates. They can choose to track whatever type of data they would like.

## Options
Students who do not have much experience can simply update the CRUD app with new types of data and new styles. More advanced students should have the opportunity to expand on the CRUD app, or create something entirely new. The final project is the best time for them to go beyond the course curriculum and explore new topics.

## Presentations
Students will be expected to present their projects at the last meeting of the semester.

## Assessment
The final projects will be the summative assessment for the entire course. Instructors should measure the success of the course by looking at the final projects, and determining how well the students used the knowledge they learned in the course. If the students are able to apply concepts and create satisfactory web apps, the course has achieved its mission.
